Our wisdom, in so far as it ought to be deemed true and solid Wisdom, consists
almost entirely of two parts: the knowledge of God and of ourselves. But as
these are connected together by many ties, it is not easy to determine which of
the two precedes and gives birth to the other. For, in the first place, no man

Our wisdom, in so far as it ought to be deemed true and solid Wisdom, consists
almost entirely of two parts: the knowledge of God and of ourselves. But as
these are connected together by many ties, it is not easy to determine which of
the two precedes and gives birth to the other. For, in the first place, no man
can survey himself without forthwith turning his thoughts towards the God in
whom he lives and moves; because it is perfectly obvious, that the endowments
which we possess cannot possibly be from ourselves; nay, that our very being is
nothing else than subsistence in God alone. In the second place, those blessings
which unceasingly distil to us from heaven, are like streams conducting us to
the fountain. Here, again, the infinitude of good which resides in God becomes
more apparent from our poverty.  In particular, the miserable ruin into which
the revolt of the first man has plunged us, compels us to turn our eyes upwards;
not only that while hungry and famishing we may thence ask what we want, but
being aroused by fear may learn humility. For as there exists in man something
like a world of misery, and ever since we were stript of the divine attire our
naked shame discloses an immense series of disgraceful properties every man,
being stung by the consciousness of his own unhappiness, in this way necessarily
obtains at least some knowledge of God. Thus, our feeling of ignorance, vanity,
want, weakness, in short, depravity and corruption, reminds us, that in the
Lord, and none but He, dwell the true light of wisdom, solid virtue, exuberant
goodness. We are accordingly urged by our own evil things to consider the good
things of God; and, indeed, we cannot aspire to Him in earnest until we have
begun to be displeased with ourselves. For what man is not disposed to rest in
himself? Who, in fact, does not thus rest, so long as he is unknown to himself;
that is, so long as he is contented with his own endowments, and unconscious or
unmindful of his misery?  Every person, therefore, on coming to the knowledge of
himself, is not only urged to seek God, but is also led as by the hand to find
him.

On the other hand, it is evident that man never attains to a true self-knowledge
until he has previously contemplated the face of God, and come down after such
contemplation to look into himself. For (such is our innate pride) we always
seem to ourselves just, and upright, and wise, and holy, until we are convinced,
by clear evidence, of our injustice, vileness, folly, and impurity. Convinced,
however, we are not, if we look to ourselves only, and not to the Lord also â€”He
being the only standard by the application of which this conviction can be
produced. For, since we are all naturally prone to hypocrisy, any empty
semblance of righteousness is quite enough to satisfy us instead of
righteousness itself. And since nothing appears within us or around us that is
not tainted with very great impurity, so long as we keep our mind within the
confines of human pollution, anything which is in some small degree less defiled
delights us as if it were most pure just as an eye, to which nothing but black
had been previously presented, deems an object of a whitish, or even of a
brownish hue, to be perfectly white. Nay, the bodily sense may furnish a still
stronger illustration of the extent to which we are deluded in estimating the
powers of the mind. If, at mid-day, we either look down to the ground, or on the
surrounding objects which lie open to our view, we think ourselves endued with a
very strong and piercing eyesight; but when we look up to the sun, and gaze at
it unveiled, the sight which did excellently well for the earth is instantly so
dazzled and confounded by the refulgence, as to oblige us to confess that our
acuteness in discerning terrestrial objects is mere dimness when applied to the
sun. Thus too, it happens in estimating our spiritual qualities. So long as we
do not look beyond the earth, we are quite pleased with our own righteousness,
wisdom, and virtue; we address ourselves in the most flattering terms, and seem
only less than demigods. But should we once begin to raise our thoughts to God,
and reflect what kind of Being he is, and how absolute the perfection of that
righteousness, and wisdom, and virtue, to which, as a standard, we are bound to
be conformed, what formerly delighted us by its false show of righteousness will
become polluted with the greatest iniquity; what strangely imposed upon us under
the name of wisdom will disgust by its extreme folly; and what presented the
appearance of virtuous energy will be condemned as the most miserable
impotence. So far are those qualities in us, which seem most perfect, from
corresponding to the divine purity.
